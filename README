This project is pretty much just a physics engine. Someday it will hopefully be
game engine, and then hopefully a game.

The physics engine is 2d and geared toward side-scrolling platformers. Entities
are made of n-sided polygons and do not rotate. I suppose this is kind of like
the physics in The Incredible Machine.

One of the major goals of this physics engine is to never let objects pass
through walls or other objects. Firing two bullets directly toward each other
might cause the bullets to pass through each other due to the discrete
resolution of naive collision detection. This physics engine solves this problem
by causing each moving object to effectively occupy the entire region of space
it would pass through for the discrete time frame of collision detection; at
least that's the plan.

Not too much is demoable yet. Sorry.



Build it with qmake and make.
