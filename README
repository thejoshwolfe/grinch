This project is pretty much just a physics engine. Someday it will hopefully be
game engine, and then hopefully a game.

The physics engine is 2d and geared toward side-scrolling platformers. Entities
are made of n-sided polygons and do not rotate. I suppose this is kind of like
the physics in The Incredible Machine.

One of the major goals of this physics engine is correctness: never let objects
pass through walls or other objects. For example, firing two bullets directly
toward each other should cause the bullets to collide rather than pass through
each other, and a stack of boxes should never occupy less height than the sum of
the heights of the boxes. This physics engine attempts to approach the issue by
plotting the intersection of moving 2d objects as 3d objects in spacetime.
Collisions would then simply be intersections of polyhedrons.

Not too much is demoable yet. Sorry.


Links against sfml. Builds with eclipse 3.7 and eclipse-cdt 6.0.

Installing dependencies in Ubuntu (tested in 11.10 oneiric):
    $ sudo apt-get install eclipse-cdt libsfml-dev


Note about system-dependent include directories:
I needed to tell the CDT editor about gcc's system include directories to hook
up all the sweet content assist features properly. My values are hardcoded into
this .cproject file, which I'm guessing will "just work" for everyone, but in
case some mysterious include path warnings crop up in your workspace, you can
find your own values with this command:
    $ $(gcc -print-prog-name=cc1plus) -v < /dev/null && rm gccdump.s 
The output should contain info on the #include <...> search path. Edit the CDT
options through the GUI like this:
    Right click the project
    -> Properties
    -> C/C++ General
    -> Paths and Symbols
    -> Includes
    -> GNU C++
or edit the .cproject file directly, but you'll want to refresh the project and
poke the gui page after doing that to update the cache or something.
