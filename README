This project is pretty much just a physics engine. Someday it will hopefully be
game engine, and then hopefully a game.

The physics engine is 2d and geared toward side-scrolling platformers. Entities
are made of n-sided polygons and do not rotate. I suppose this is kind of like
the physics in The Incredible Machine.

One of the major goals of this physics engine is correctness: never let objects
pass through walls or other objects. For example, firing two bullets directly
toward each other should cause the bullets to collide rather than pass through
each other, and a stack of boxes should never occupy less height than the sum of
the heights of the boxes. This physics engine attempts to approach the issue by
plotting the intersection of moving 2d objects as 3d objects in spacetime.
Collisions would then simply be intersections of polyhedrons.

Not too much is demoable yet. Sorry.



Build it with qmake and make.
